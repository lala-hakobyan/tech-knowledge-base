# How to Improve Focus and Become Indistractable at Work

I took 2025 to be self-employed to work on my own projects and initiatives, explore AI for engineering and business, and learn new skills - a journey that would have been impossible while working full-time. I anticipated challenges along the way, from the fear of sharing my knowledge with the community, to stepping out of my comfort zone, to navigating the technical complexities.

But it appeared that the biggest challenge was maintaining **focus**. I always knew soft skills matter, especially that **focus is crucial for productivity as an engineer and leader**, but this journey revealed it in a new way. When you have a manager or product owner to align priorities and clear requirements, it is easier to stay focused on what is important. But when you are on your own, and you set the requirements, deadlines, and priorities yourself, it is much harder to stay focused and move in the right direction.

The program (book) by Nir Eyal, **"Becoming Focused and Indistractable"**, helped me find patterns for staying focused during this journey. Beyond practical tips, I loved how he explains everything through science (neurology) and psychology - how our brains build habits and how we can retrain them, how to find the root cause of distractions, and simple methods to fix them.

In this article, I will share a couple of tips I have used both as an engineer and as a leader to stay focused, along with new patterns I learned from this book this year.

First, let’s cover the fundamentals. According to Nir Eyal, there are two key concepts: **traction** and **distraction**.
- **Distraction** is any action that moves you away from what you really want.
- **Traction** is any action that moves you towards what you really want.

As the author explains, there are two types of triggers for distraction: **internal** and **external**.
- **Internal triggers** are when you distract yourself - like reaching for your phone in the middle of focused work, or scrolling social media to avoid the discomfort of hard work.
- **External triggers** are distractions around you - like a sweet colleague coming to chat over coffee, or unexpected meetings during your planned focus time.

The important point is that the same action can be traction if it is planned, and distraction if it is not.   
**For example**, if you planned to spend time with your kid, checking work email is a distraction. But when you are at work, and checking email during the time you allocated for it, it is traction. And if you start playing with your kid during that time, it becomes a distraction.
Below are some tips to stay more focused and be more productive at work:

**1. Plan Your Goals**   
**Set your priorities and end goals** for a day, a week, a month, or high-level goals for a year or more. If you don't set priorities and goals, you won't know what is **distraction** and what is **traction** for you.  
If you have them set up, each time you take on a task, ask yourself: **Is this traction towards my goals and priorities, or is it distraction?** This simple pattern helps you choose actions and tasks that move you closer to your goals, whether it is for a day, a week, a month, or a year.

**2. Time Boxing**   
Time boxing is a technique based on **setting an implementation intention**. It helps you decide **what** you are going to do and **when** you are going to do it and **how much time** you want to spend on each event / task.   
A good way to timebox your plans is to block time in your **calendar**, or use a **spreadsheet** to track, hour by hour, what you will do. Planning your day or week ahead gives you a clear overview of **what is traction** and **what is distraction** for you and allows you **not to exceed the time** allocated for specific tasks.

As for me, I record all high-level events in Google Calendar, both personal and work-related. Then I plan my week using a simple Excel sheet - hour by hour, I add what I need to do each day, even if it is time for watching a movie or playing with my cats.

**3. Schedule Focus Work Hours**  
As Nir Eyal explains, research suggests that when you get distracted or switch context, it can take 20-25 minutes to regain focus. That is why focused work is one of the most important factors for productivity.   
Try **short focus sessions** - 1-2 hours of deep work, then 5-10 minutes of rest. This way you make progress, and you still have time for a quick mental reset - checking email or chats, responding to urgent requests, or connecting with colleagues. Adjust the timing based on your needs.

**4. Eliminate Phone Distractions**   
We all know that our **phones are the #1 source of our distractions**. Whether it is playing a game, checking notifications, or scrolling social media, the phone is the most common **internal distraction trigger**.
Many people build a habit of reaching for their phone because of inner discomfort or boredom, or when work feels hard. It feels like a quick mental reset. But then it turns into a social media trap, and you suddenly find yourself watching cute cat videos or short reels for far too long. **Because this habit is linked with a pleasant feeling, the brain reinforces it** - and each time we feel bored or uncomfortable, we reach for the phone again.   
That is why the advice is - try not to reach for your phone during breaks between focus sessions, and especially not during focused work.   
- If the work feels boring, try to dive deeper and find some joy and playfulness in what you are doing - deeper engagement reduces boredom.
- You can also do stretching, a short walk, or even sketch in your notebook.
- One of the most productive things you can do during a break is simply think and do nothing else. Research suggests that quiet thinking can help you generate great ideas. By not reaching for your phone or scrolling social media, you help your brain retrain old habits and change them.

Another good optimization is to rearrange your phone apps into sections like **Work**, **Social**, **Money**, **Important**, etc., so that if you do check your phone, you open only what matters and do not get distracted by other apps.

**5. Disable Unnecessary Notifications**   
Unnecessary notifications are one of the **main reasons for distraction during focused work**. Disable notifications from Slack, email, and social media on both desktop and mobile and leave only the necessary ones.   
One useful method to stay really indistractable during focused work is to turn on **Do Not Disturb**, or a similar focus mode, on your desktop and phone. During this time, notifications are off, so you do not feel the need to check anything.
Additionally, you can agree on a special word like **"URGENT"**  with your family, and set up your phone so it notifies you only when that specific type of message arrives.

**6. Spend Less Time on Checking Emails**   
Email is the biggest distraction at work. As Nir Eyal explains, researchers have concluded that 25% of email time is spent reading emails that should not have been sent. And 25% is spent responding to emails that should never have been answered.

If you check the email and see it is not urgent, **don’t answer immediately**, instead categorize your emails into **“today”** and **“this week”** categories, set aside time in your calendar to go over emails per day and per week. This way you touch email only twice, once when categorizing it and next time, when sending it. Also by delaying reply you give issues or questions time to be resolved by themselves.

Other useful optimizations are:
  - **Unsubscribe from email newsletters** you are not interested in.
  - **Set up different Inbox types for different email categories**, like Slack Notifications, GitHub Notifications, Important (Customer Support, Production Issues) etc. This way you will first concentrate on what is really important.

**7. Avoid Unnecessary Meetings**  
Before scheduling a meeting, ask yourself - **Does this person really need to be there?** And when you are invited to a meeting, ask the same. You will be surprised how many topics can be handled quickly by email or chat - and how many meetings you can skip to protect your focus time.

**8. Use Symbols Showing You are Indistractable**   
To reduce external triggers - like colleagues or family interrupting your focused work - put a focused work label on your laptop.
**For example,** “Sorry, I am doing focused work now. If it is not urgent, please message me. Meanwhile, help yourself with candies :)”
This creates a nice moment: someone approaches, sees you are in focus mode, grabs a candy, and you can continue working without breaking focus.   
If you work from home, you can put a similar label on your door, so nobody knocks.

**9. Learn to Say No**   
To stay focused on your deliverables, you need to **categorize incoming requests**, especially as a leader. If you respond to every message and request, you risk not completing high-priority work.
A technique I used is this: when I need to focus, I ask a team member: Is this urgent? Is it blocking your work? Can I deliver it by the end of the day, or later this week? In most cases, you can delay the response. This often gives issues time to resolve on their own, and it also supports autonomy for your team members, while you stay focused on higher-priority goals.

**10. Create an Indistractible Working Environment - For Leaders**   
The root cause of distraction at work is a dysfunctional company culture - unnecessary meetings, not high priority discussions, unorganized work that causes context switching.
- Keep the work and processes organized and meetings short and to the point to keep the team focused.
- Create a safe working environment for your team, where team members will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.
Teams that foster safety and facilitate regular open discussions about concerns have happier and more focused employees and consequently more satisfied customers.

I hope these simple tips help you stay focused and productive at work. Becoming indistractable can be a game-changing goal - it helps you achieve both personal and career goals.   
One more thing: being focused does not mean becoming cold. In fact, I was the one leading our Coffee Hours, organizing lunch breaks, and being active in social events, while still protecting my focus during work. It is more the opposite - **focus and productivity help you make space for genuine interactions** with colleagues, family, and friends, and still move forward with your personal goals, which leads to a **healthier work-life balance**.
