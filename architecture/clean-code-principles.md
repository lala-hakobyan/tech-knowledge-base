# Clean Code Principles
**Clean Code principles** were firstly introduced by Robert C. Martinâ€™s book "Clean Code". By adhering to these principles, developers can create code that is more maintainable, readable, and easier to collaborate on, leading to higher quality software.
- Based on that book, **Clean Code** is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.    
- It prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness over cleverness or complexity.    
- Key principles include **using meaningful names**, **writing small functions**, **avoiding duplication**, **eliminating side effects**, and **keeping code expressive**.

## Detailed Breakdown of Clean Code Principles
### 1. Meaningful Names
- Use descriptive and unambiguous names for variables, functions, and classes that clearly indicate their purpose.
- Avoid single-letter names or cryptic abbreviations.
- Choose names that are easy to pronounce and search for.
- Example: `getUserInfo()` is better than `getData()`.

### 2. Small Functions:
- Functions should ideally be short and focused on a single task. Aim for functions that are no more than 20-30 lines long, and ideally even shorter.
- Aim for functions with three or fewer parameters.
- Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
- Avoid flag arguments - use separate functions for different operations. 

### 3. Avoid Duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself):
- Identify and eliminate duplicated code by extracting it into reusable functions or modules.
- Use functions, classes, or existing libraries to avoid redundancy.

### 4. Eliminate Side Effects:
- Functions should ideally have no side effects, meaning they should only perform the task they are intended for without altering external state.
- Avoid methods that both change object state and return values: use separate methods for each.

### 6. Keep Code Expressive:
- Write code that explains itself, minimizing the need for comments.
- Use comments to explain complex logic or clarify intent, but avoid obvious or redundant comments.
- Remove commented-out code - it's better to refactor or delete it.

### 6. Consistency:
- Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project, including naming conventions, formatting, and indentation.
- Use tools like linters and formatters to enforce consistent style.

### 7. Simplicity:
- Favor simple and straightforward solutions over complex or clever ones.
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.

### 8. Modularity (Separation of Concerns):
- Break down code into smaller, self-contained modules or components.
- Each module/class/function should have a single responsibility.
- This promotes reusability, encapsulation, and easier maintenance.

### 9. Testability:
- Write code that is easy to test, with clear separation of concerns.
- Use unit tests to verify the behavior of individual components.
