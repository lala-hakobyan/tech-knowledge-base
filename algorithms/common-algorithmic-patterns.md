# Common Algorithmic Patterns 
Many developers approach coding platforms like LeetCode with the goal of solving as many problems as possible. While consistent practice is key, a far more effective strategy is to master the underlying **algorithmic patterns**.

Recognizing a pattern is like having a blueprint. It allows you to quickly understand a problem's core structure and apply a proven, efficient solution, rather than trying to invent one from scratch every time. This guide is a collection of these essential patterns and data structures. For each one, we'll cover:
- **How to Spot This Pattern:** The clues in a problem description.
- **The Core Idea:** The fundamental logic behind the pattern.
- **Typical Problems:** Classic examples you'll encounter.

By focusing on patterns, you'll build a powerful mental model for turning complex problems into familiar, solvable challenges.

## Core Algorithmic Strategies

### Recursion / Backtracking

### Divide and Conquer

### Greedy Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

---

## Patterns for Sequential Data (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)

### Two Pointers (Includes Fast & Slow Pointers)

### Sliding Window

### Prefix Sum (and Difference Array)

### In-place Reversal of a Linked List

---

## Tree Patterns 

### Tree Traversal (BFS & DFS)
#### BFS (Level-Order Traversal): For level-by-level problems and shortest path from root.
#### DFS (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order): For pathfinding, validation, and structural problems.

### Patterns for Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

### Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

---

## Graph Patterns

### Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)
#### BFS: Shortest path in an unweighted graph.
#### DFS: Connectivity, cycle detection, and finding connected components.

### Topological Sort (For Directed Acyclic Graphs)

### Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

---

## Data Structure-Based Patterns
### Stack (including the **Monotonic Stack** pattern)
### Heap / Priority Queue (solves "Top 'K' Elements" problems)
### Hash Map / Set (for frequency counting, lookups)
### Trie (for prefix-based string problems)

---

## Other Key Techniques
### Modified Binary Search
### Interval Merging
### Bit Manipulation
### Math & Geometry
